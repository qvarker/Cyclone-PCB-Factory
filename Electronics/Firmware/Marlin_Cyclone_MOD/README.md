Quick Information  
===================
You must setup two endstops for the Z axis, the lower one is considered our "probe"  

_Pin definitions (from "pins.h")_  
<pre>
  <code>
// We are using the Z_MIN endstop as a probe  
// Also, we have our Z_MAX endstop to limit the vertical movement of the spindle  
#define Z_PROBE_PIN 27  // using Sanguinololu, pin 36 (D27) , labeled A4  
#define Z_PROBE_HIT_VALUE 0 // Switch this if your probe gives an inverted value  
  </code>
