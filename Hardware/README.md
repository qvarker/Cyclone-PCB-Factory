Hardware for Cyclone-PCB-Factory  
===================

To-Do list  
--  
There are plenty of work fronts open, as many task are pending:

* Tougher parts (great ongoing work!):
 * Stronger holders for the linear bearings (vibration makes them slide away)
 * Reinforce screw holders
* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner
* Better scalability (particularly for the Y axis)
* Better spindle motor design:
 * Brushless motor for the spindle
 * Spindle speed control
* Integrated endstop holders

Notes  
--  
- Using a thick wood piece as the main base.  
- As shown in one of the pictures, a cheap dremel-like drill has nice bearings and is a good option as the main tool. **Finally it will be using a proper spindle** (check the BOM for the reference).  
- Desired working range of >=100mm for the X axis and >=160mm for the Y axis.  
- Parts are designed to be printable with the small volume of a Printrbot Jr  
- Bed leveling is done with probing and an appropriate software.

Special thanks  
--  
- Z axis concepts by **Quim Borras** and the spindle motor holder by **Misan** were really useful!! Also, **Diego Viejo**'s machine was of great inspiration for the Z axis (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113930344830086538817/albums/5868944432651911713?authkey=CLDJgdehlN773gE>) **Thank you all!!**  
- This design woudn't have been possible without the encouragement of the **Panda CNC community** (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>)  
- Also, thanks to **Juan González-Gómez (Obijuan <http://iearobotics.com>)** for naming the machine Cyclone :)

The origin of Cyclone took place while I was inside the **Panda CNC** community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>). This is from December 2012 to mid-February 2013.  
Here is the credit for the ideas that were used:  

* _Let's design a 3D-printable CNC for PCB milling, it will be named Panda:_ **Guillermo Welch** (mid-December, via Google Talk)  
* _X carriage rod distribution:_ **César Augusto Fernández Cano** claims Cyclone's X axis is a derivate of his concept: <https://plus.google.com/u/0/111421387442355054591/posts/QrfYtEuZBaj>

* _Regarding the woodbase:_ **Guillermo Welch** always contemplated the possibility of attaching the machine (optionally) to a woodbase. I decided to use the base as a main structural part instead. See <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/woodbase.png> (screenshot from <https://plus.google.com/u/0/113437723819360223498/posts/8LDCSSVWqCS>)

Please note I have taken screenshots of the post that are on the closed G+ Panda community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116318709564872967169>). You can register and see by yourself.  

**All other development present on Cyclone has nothing to do with Panda and is not related to the Panda project.**
